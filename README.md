Knots and games of the tic-tac-toe type
===

This was my Final Project for my Industrial Design Engineering Degree, it was done with the help and support of Pedro González Manchón.
The Final Project paper (in Spanish) can be found [here](https://oa.upm.es/77063/).

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to create a game inspired by knot theory on a board reminiscent of the typical grid of the tic tac toe game. In order to achieve this, some aspects of knot theory were studied and it was also necessary to understand the basic principles of topology. Some of the topics in knot theory that have been explored in depth are the dealternating number, the Kauffman bracket, the Jones polynomial or the Turaev surface of the diagram of a knot. This research is developed in the first part of the work.

Next, calculation tools, such as an algorithm to determine the Jones polynomial based on grid diagrams, and visualization tools for knot diagrams and their associated Turaev surfaces were programmed. Physical models of these surfaces were also 3D printed, in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the maze that these surfaces create.

Finally, two versions of a computer game were built applying the concepts studied in the theoretical part and using the tools previously developed.

## Coding

### Calculation and visualization tools

The [PyArcKnot Python Package](https://github.com/inigorrix/pyarcknot) was developed to studying the arc diagrams of mathematical knots.
For an in-depth demonstration of the possibilities available, check out the [Jupyter Notebook demo](https://github.com/inigorrix/pyarcknot_demo/blob/main/pyarcknot_demo.ipynb).

## 3D Printing

### 3D Printed Game

A set of 3 modular pieces was developped to create a game where any Turaev surface could be made interlocking the pieces.

### 3D Printed Turaev Surfaces

Physical models of some interesting Turaev surfaces were 3D printed.
With and without the "lids".
